gitreminder.py

A tool that will scan through a filesystem path for git repositories and check
if they have uncommited files or if they have any branches that are not pushed
to the remote server yet.

TODO/IDEAS:
- add ability to do everything automatically or by manually confirm each step
  (like --quiet or --assume-yes)
- add ability to ssh/sftp/scp a zipped version of the repository to a remote
  location
- add better error handling
- support Windows
- support setup.py / pip install / setuptools:
  http://guide.python-distribute.org/
- automated update mechanism for the script itself: updates itself from a
  defined url, comparing the version number and if the downloaded one is
  newer, than update (ask user to update, also present dialog with the
  CHANGES that were made)
- add support for local configuration file in ~/.gitreminder/gitreminder.conf
  (format should be in JSON)
- IMPORTANT: should really check ALL branches, not only the currently active
  one...

Please do not poisen the global namespace with global functions, instead use
a class with static or class functions. Thank you.
